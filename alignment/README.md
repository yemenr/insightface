We provide our implementation of ``Stacked Dense U-Nets with Dual Transformers for Robust Face Alignment`` here at [BMVC](http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/0051.pdf) or link at [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01936).

We also provide some popular heatmap based approaches like stacked hourglass, etc..  You can define different loss-type/network structure/dataset in ``config.py``(from ``sample_config.py``).

For example, by default, you can train our approach by ``train.py --network sdu`` or train hourglass network by ``train.py --network hourglass``.
